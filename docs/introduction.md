# Clawr: Coding with Roaring Clarity

![Rawr|200][rawr.svg]

It started as the “Azeea Language,” or Azlan for short. Aslan, of course, is “the Lion” in the title of C.S. Lewis’ famous book *the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*. The name was at the same time not very unique, and too tied to the company name. I tried discarding the lion concept entirely, instead going with Oolang (mild tea) for a while. But that name was too cute, and the lion kept roaring in the background. So I have brought it back.

The name Clawr is a portmanteau of the word ”clarity,” and a lion’s “rawr.” The alternative spelling was chosen in part because the resulting name spells out the word “claw,” another stereotypical signifier of felinity.

Clarity is a fundamental goal of the Clawr language. Other principles include

- a focus on modelling rather than technicalities
- easy refactoring (even without automated tools)
- encouraging variable isolation (what other languages call “value semantics”)
- encouraging encapsulation (but allowing data-oriented programming too)

Clawr’s goal is not just to help you tell computers what to do — it’s to help you express your ideas clearly, so others (and your future self) can understand them.

Let’s start with something simple — [your first Clawr program](./getting-started.md).
